web-presence
============

Web Presence provides presence for devices that expose their services to web pages. The current reference implementation of Web Presence is using Freddo/DTalk (https://code.google.com/p/freddo/) and JavaEE WebSocket technologies.

Web Presence security relies on WIFI security. Devices do only expose their local IP address to the remote Web Presence server. Nobody outside your LAN has access to the devices that expose their services to web pages.

The latest version of Web Presence server is deployed at:
